Single Particle Detection

This project consists of a bunch of utilities for detecting single nanoparticles in microscopy images, using scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT). It's all developed for Matlab 2013a.

Utilities include tracking particles across multiple images, matching particles in 'before' and 'after' images, and summarizing properties
